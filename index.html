The Race for the Cure Series is the largest series of 5K runs/fitness walks in the world. In 2002, races will be held in more than 100 U.S cities and three foreign countries with over 1.3 million participants expected. The National Race in D.C. has grown exponentially each year from 7,000 participants in 1990 to 72,328 in 2001.  The Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation was established in 1982 by Nancy Brinker to honor the memory of her sister, Susan G. Komen, who died of breast cancer at the age of 36. The Komen Foundation and its Affiliates have raised in excess of $400 million since the Foundation&#039;s inception. Photo: John Harrington"></div>
